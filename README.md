# laz-y-loot

This app was made to streamline the process of manipulating autoloot settings for MQ2-E3. The name comes from Lazarus server which is where I play!

## Disclaimer

Although the app takes backups of your ini file, it is highly recommended that you periodically take your own backups. The app is still in ALPHA and there are going to be bugs!

## Contact

If you want to get in touch, message Xyile on Lazarus or on Discord. I will see issues posted so feel free to use Github for that if you have a problem with it.
