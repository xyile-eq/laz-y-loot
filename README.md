# laz-y-loot

This app was made to streamline the process of manipulating autoloot settings for MQ2-E3. The name comes from Lazarus server which is where I play!

## Is this a virus?

No, it's not, that's why the source code is posted here for all to see. The releases are also build in Github so you can review the source and build it yourself if you wish. There is a good chance your computer will say "This was downloaded from the internet, are you sure?" because it is not codesigned, but I encourage you with any downloaded exe to first drag and drop it to virustotal.com before running it.

## Disclaimer

Although the app takes backups of your ini file, it is highly recommended that you periodically take your own backups. The app is still in ALPHA and there are going to be bugs!

## Contact

If you want to get in touch, message Xyile on Lazarus or on Discord. I will see issues posted so feel free to use Github for that if you have a problem with it.
